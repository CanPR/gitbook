First and foremost, it's important to recognize that the qualifications needed to enter the Express Entry pool may not be the same as those that can maximize your CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) score.

Take language proficiency, for instance, which holds significant weight in the CRS, contributing up to 310 points when considered alongside other factors like post-secondary education. If the applicant is married or in a common-law relationship, this score can increase to 320.

Language proficiency is an area where candidates often have the opportunity to enhance their score. Points can be gained by surpassing the minimum language requirements. While the Federal Skilled Worker program mandates a minimum of CLB 7 (all abilities), candidates can earn additional points by progressively improving scores for each ability, up to CLB 10.

Moreover, language proficiency plays a crucial role in various sections of the CRS, including human capital factors, spousal factors for those married or in a common-law partnership, skill-transferability "combinations," and additional factors.

**Education**

Education can count for up to 200 CRS points if one studied exclusively outside of Canada, and up to 250 points if one has a post-secondary credential from Canada. You can improve your initial education score by obtaining additional credentials, for example completing another degree, or by obtaining additional Educational Credential Assessments (ECAs) for existing degrees.

An ECA is required in order to obtain CRS points for education obtained outside of Canada.

For the Federal Skilled Worker Class candidates educated outside of Canada, only one ECA is required of the principal applicant in order to enter the pool.

For candidates in the Federal Skilled Trades Class or the Canadian Experience Class, no ECA is required to enter the Express Entry pool.

\


**Spouse or Common-law Partner Might be a Better Principal Applicant**

If you are married or in a common-law partnership, it could be advantageous to assess and compare your CRS scores as potential principal applicants.

In certain scenarios, the CRS score of the primary applicant may turn out to be lower than that of their accompanying spouse or common-law partner. In such instances, it might be prudent for the spouse or common-law partner to take on the role of the principal applicant.

To illustrate, let's consider a situation where the CRS score of the spouse or common-law partner could potentially make them a more suitable choice as the principal applicant.

**Work Experience**

Accumulating additional work experience or providing a more comprehensive documentation of your existing work experience can significantly boost your CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) score.

It's worth noting that certain candidates, despite having job titles that may initially seem unskilled, might have undertaken duties that align with Canada's National Occupation Classification (NOC) criteria for skilled work.

Looking beyond job titles and aligning the tasks performed with the duties outlined in the NOC for various occupations is crucial. This evaluation helps determine whether your work is categorized as skilled or unskilled, potentially leading to the claiming of additional points.

Once the appropriate NOC for your work experience is identified, the next step involves calculating the duration spent in each job. Points are allocated for full-time or equivalent part-time work experience.

For candidates under the Federal Skilled Worker Class, a minimum of one year of continuous, skilled work experience is required to enter the Express Entry pool. Importantly, even non-continuous work experience can contribute towards earning CRS points, providing an avenue for candidates to enhance their overall score.

**Valid Job Offer**&#x20;

Individuals[^1] holding a valid job offer have the opportunity to augment their CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) score with either 50 or 200 additional points, contingent on the nature of the position.

For candidates with a valid job offer in an occupation falling under the NOC (National Occupation Classification) 0, A, or B level, an extra 50 points are allocated towards their CRS score. Meanwhile, candidates securing a valid job offer in an occupation categorized within Major Group 00 Senior Management Occupations may receive an impressive 200 additional points under the CRS.

It's emphasized by IRCC (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada) that a qualifying job offer must be in written form, providing comprehensive details on job requirements, including salary and deductions, job duties, and employment conditions.

\


**Work Experience and Provincial Nominee Program**&#x20;

\
Providing a detailed and accurate account of your work experience can open the door to eligibility for nomination by one of Canada's Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). Successfully nominated Express Entry candidates by a Canadian province for permanent residence receive a substantial boost of 600 additional points added to their CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) score.

It's essential to note that provinces might seek candidates with particular work experience that, although possessed by the candidate, might not be perceived as relevant due to its lack of connection to the principal occupation.

\


**Express Entry Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) offer various pathways for candidates, and noteworthy among these are programs that:**

Do not consider the candidate's CRS score as a prerequisite for eligibility.

Are open to candidates with no prior ties to Canada, such as relatives, job offers, or previous Canadian work or study experience.

These PNPs represent a valuable opportunity for Express Entry candidates and have gained significant popularity. Some of these programs operate on a first-come, first-served basis and often reach their intake limits rapidly, sometimes within a day of opening. Successful application to these programs often relies on proactive preparation.

An example of such a first-come, first-served PNP stream is the Nova Scotia Demand: Express Entry.

\


**Ontario Human Capital Priorities Stream**

Another PNP that may reward proactive candidates is Ontario’s popular Express Entry-linked Human Capital Priorities Stream.

This stream follows a so-called passive model that allows Ontario to search the Express Entry pool and select candidates with a CRS score above 400 and who have the specific skills that match the province’s labour needs. It is worth noting, however, that Ontario once waived the 400 CRS point requirement for IT professionals.

Express Entry candidates who receive an invitation through the Human Capital Priorities Stream must submit their application within 45 days, which can be a tight timeline in which to collect all the required documents.

Besides collecting documents, Ontario has advised Express Entry candidates interested in the Human Capital Priorities Stream to create a new profile in the Express Entry system. Doing so makes it easier for Ontario to identify the candidates' profiles when Ontario searches the Express Entry pool.

As is the case with the Nova Scotia Express Entry stream mentioned above, candidates who are interested in the Ontario Human Capital Priorities Stream should keep a close eye on new developments with the stream, and take steps to be proactive if or when an opportunity presents itself.

Other Express Entry-linked PNPs

The provinces of Manitoba and Prince Edward Island both introduced streams where eligible Express Entry candidates can also proactively submit profiles to the provinces, which then rank candidates within their own pools and ranking systems.

The Province of New Brunswick has also opened its Express Entry Labour Market Stream for limited periods, both to IT professionals and others.

One factor all of these different PNPs have in common is that they reward proactive, informed candidates.

PNPs will continue to play a prominent role in terms of economic immigration to Canada through 2020 and 2021, with significant increases each year in admission targets. So keep your eye on PNPs, and get busy preparing those documents!
