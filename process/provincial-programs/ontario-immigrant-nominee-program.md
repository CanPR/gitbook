# Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program

**Overview**

Ontario, home to bustling cities like Toronto and Ottawa, is a land of immense opportunities. The Ontario Immigration Nominee Program (OINP) selects skilled workers from across the globe to permanently settle and work in Ontario.

Both the Government of Canada and Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada are responsible for administering the OINP to meet Ontario's labor market needs.

The program consists of three streams: employer job offer, human capital, and business, each with its own set of requirements. Successful applicants can apply for Ontario Permanent Residence and benefit from the vast opportunities the province offers.

**Who Can Apply**

* Candidates with a valid job offer from an employer in Ontario
* Candidates with a Master's or PhD from a university in Ontario
* Candidates selected through Express Entry
* Candidates with the capital to start a business in Ontario

**How Long it Takes**

Approximately 2 to 6 months, including processing.

**How It Works**

Ontario is one of the most popular provinces in Canada, offering numerous job opportunities. Skilled workers can qualify for the OINP through two streams:

* **Employer Job Offer Stream**: Requires a valid full-time job offer from an Ontario employer.
* **Human Capital Stream**: Candidates must either have a Master's or PhD from an Ontario university or apply through Express Entry. If applying through Express Entry, candidates must submit a regular profile and, if selected by Ontario, respond to the invitation of interest with supporting documents within 45 days. Ontario sends notifications of interest to eligible candidates through Express Entry.

Successful applicants can then apply for Ontario Permanent Residence and embark on a life full of opportunities in the bustling province.
