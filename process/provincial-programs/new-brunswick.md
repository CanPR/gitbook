**Overview**

The New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program (NBPNP) invites skilled workers to contribute to the economic prosperity of the Canadian province. It offers multiple streams, including the Express Entry stream, Skilled Workers with Family Support stream, and Skilled Workers with Employer Support stream.

The application process varies for each stream, with Express Entry candidates either creating a profile and being selected by NBPNP or submitting an Expression of Interest directly to NBPNP. Selected candidates receive an Invitation to Apply and must respond with required documents for permanent residence.

Skilled Workers with Employer Support and Skilled Workers with Family Support also require an Expression of Interest, followed by an Invitation to Apply. Once approved, candidates can plan their move to New Brunswick and start a new life.

**Who Can Apply**

* Candidates applying or selected through the Express Entry system
* Skilled Workers with Family Support
* Skilled Workers with Employer Support

**How Long it Takes**

The processing time is typically 2 to 6 months.

**How It Works**

New Brunswick PNP offers three streams: Express Entry, Employer Support, and Family Support.

* Skilled Workers with Employer Support: Candidates with a job offer in NB submit an application with proof of education, experience, job offer, and funds.
