# British Columbia

**Overview**

The British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program (BCPNP) is administered by the government of British Columbia to select immigration candidates for nomination to the Canadian government for permanent residency in the province, thereby contributing to economic growth.

The BCPNP offers 10 different immigration streams, providing a diverse range of options for skilled workers, international graduates in Canada, and post-graduates in British Columbia. These streams include Express Entry BC, Skills Immigration, and an entrepreneur category.

**How It Works**

The BC-PNP is distinguished by its two broad streams for workers and graduates: Express Entry BC and Skills Immigration, along with an additional stream for entrepreneurs.

Within these streams, various categories exist. Some align with Canadaâ€™s federal Express Entry system, providing successful applicants with an additional 600 Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) points and an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence. Others operate under the Skills Immigration Registration System (SIRS), where candidates register profiles and are invited to apply based on periodic draws and their score.

While some categories require a job offer from a BC employer, others do not. Additionally, the Tech Pilot program targets IT and technology workers for expedited processing, with specific in-demand occupations identified for eligibility.
