# Prince Edward Island

**Overview**

Prince Edward Island (PEI) Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) targets skilled workers through three streams: Express Entry, Business, and Labor. Being the smallest of Canada's provinces and highly agricultural-based, PEI PNP has requirements tailored to its unique characteristics.

Candidates are assessed based on skills, experience, and adaptability to life in PEI, similar to other provincial nominee programs. Unskilled or semi-skilled workers are also eligible due to the significance of farming and agriculture in the region.

Successful candidates receive a provincial nominee certificate, making them eligible to apply for permanent residence in Canada. The highest scoring applicants receive an invitation to apply for permanent residence, enabling them to start a new life in Canada once their documents are submitted and processed.

**Who Can Apply**

* Candidates selected through Express Entry
* Skilled workers with a valid job offer in PEI
* Semi-skilled or unskilled workers with a job offer in PEI
* Candidates interested in owning or investing in a business in PEI

**How Long it Takes**

Approximately 4 to 6 months to receive a selection certificate and 6 to 8 months to process the Permanent Residency application.

**How It Works**

PEI PNP is open to skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled workers to meet the province's labor market needs. Three streams are available:

* **PEI Express Entry**: Candidates with an Express Entry profile may be selected by PEI PNP based on labor market requirements. Upon receiving an Invitation of Interest, candidates must respond and submit required documents. Once approved, they receive a selection certificate and can apply for PEI PR, making it one of the fastest routes to settle in Canada.
* **Skilled Worker Stream**: For workers with a valid job offer from a PEI employer and a post-secondary degree or higher. Only those employed in skilled professions are eligible.
* **Critical Worker Stream**: Semi-skilled or unskilled workers with a valid job offer from a PEI employer. Candidates need minimal education, some work experience, and basic language fluency.
* **International Graduate Stream**: Recent graduates from PEI universities or colleges with a valid offer from a PEI employer.

All streams require candidates to be aged 21-59, possess adequate English/French language skills, and have sufficient funds to settle in Canada initially. Other requirements related to work experience and education vary among streams.
