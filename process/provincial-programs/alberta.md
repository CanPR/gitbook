**Overview**

The Canada Alberta Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) offers two streams for potential applicants: the Alberta Express Entry Stream and the Alberta Opportunity Stream.

The Alberta Express Entry Stream is designed for individuals with work experience in occupations that are in demand in Alberta's labor market. Applicants can either have an Express Entry profile in the pool or apply directly to the Alberta PNP. Assessment criteria include work experience, education, language proficiency, and other relevant factors. \
\
Applicants who already have experience working in Alberta, are graduates from Canadian post-secondary institutions, or have immediate relatives living in Alberta have a higher chance of selection. Upon selection, candidates receive a notification of interest and must then submit the required documents along with an application for permanent residence.

The Alberta Opportunity Stream targets individuals with work experience in Alberta who currently hold temporary work permits or temporary residence status. Selection criteria are based on occupation, work experience, language proficiency, and other factors related to their duration in Canada.

**Who Can Apply**

Candidates eligible for the Alberta Opportunity Stream include those working in Alberta with a full-time job offer. Candidates with an Express Entry Profile in the Federal Express Entry System and a minimum score of 300 who receive a notification of interest to apply to the Alberta PNP are also eligible.

**How Long it Takes**

The processing time for International Skilled Workers under the Alberta PNP is approximately 6-8 months.

**How It Works**

To qualify for Alberta's Express Entry Stream, candidates must have a profile in the Federal Express Entry pool. Candidates showing interest in living and working in Alberta or those deemed valuable to Alberta's economic development due to their occupation or work experience/skill set have a chance of being selected. The candidate must have at least 300 points in the Comprehensive Ranking System. \
\
Upon receiving a notification of interest in their Federal Express Entry profile, the candidate must respond to the Alberta PNP (AINP) within two weeks with a copy of the notification. AINP will then provide further instructions for submitting an application, including a checklist of required documents. After submitting the application, candidates must await processing and permanent residence approval from the Alberta PNP, paving the way for their relocation and a new chapter in their lives.
