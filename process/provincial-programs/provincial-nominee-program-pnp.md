# Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)

The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) can be a viable option if you believe your Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score is not competitive enough. PNPs are immigration pathways established by provincial and territorial governments to select candidates they deem suitable to address specific labor market needs within their respective regions.

Each province or territory has its own set of criteria and requirements for their PNP streams. Some may require a full-time job offer from a Canadian employer, while others do not. The application processes also vary, with some provinces utilizing electronic systems and others relying on traditional mail methods. Additionally, certain provinces may prioritize applicants whose occupations align with specific National Occupational Classification (NOC) codes.

Obtaining a provincial nomination can significantly boost your CRS score by adding 600 points, making you more likely to receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) in the subsequent Express Entry draw.

For candidates with CRS scores below 410, pursuing PNPs may be the only viable option to enhance their immigration prospects.
