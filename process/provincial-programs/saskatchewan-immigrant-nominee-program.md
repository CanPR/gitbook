# Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program

**Overview**

The Saskatchewan PNP (Provincial Nominee Program) is a popular pathway to Canadian citizenship, offering competitive processing times and abundant opportunities. This program invites applicants across four categories: International Skilled Worker Category, Saskatchewan Experience Category, Entrepreneur Category, and Farm Category.

Similar to other skilled immigration programs, applicants applying through the International Skilled Worker Program must either possess a valid employment offer, be proficient or have experience in a demanded occupation, or initially apply through Express Entry.

Applicants selected from the Express Entry pool receive an invitation of interest, submit documents, and can apply for permanent residence. Those with an employment offer experience a shorter process and higher success rate, although application numbers are limited annually.

Candidates on the in-demand occupation list must have work experience in one of the demanded trades, be financially stable to support relocation and settlement in Saskatchewan, and proficient in English and/or French. This stream is unique in PNPs as a prior job offer is not required.

**Who Can Apply**

* Candidates with a valid job offer from a Saskatchewan employer
* Candidates applying through Express Entry and selected by Saskatchewan
* Candidates employed in an occupation on the SINP in-demand occupation list

**How Long it Takes**

* International Skilled Workers: 30 days to 3 months to receive a nomination
* Processing of Permanent Residence application: 6-8 months

**How It Works**

Applicants under the International Skilled Worker Program must meet the required points based on skilled work experience, language fluency, and education.

Candidates must possess a valid job offer from a Canadian employer in Saskatchewan, be employed in a listed occupation as per labor market requirements, or apply through the Express Entry System and receive an Invitation of Interest from the Saskatchewan PNP.

For those with a valid job offer, the process is smoother, although there's an annual cap on processed applications.

Applicants with occupations on the SINP in-demand list submit an Expression of Interest, evaluated based on a point system considering factors like age, work experience, education, language fluency, and financial circumstances/settlement plan.

Highest-scoring applicants receive an invitation to apply, followed by a final submission of documents.

Candidates through the Express Entry System can also be selected by Saskatchewan as per provincial labor needs, receiving an Invitation of Interest.

After receiving an Invitation of Interest, candidates prepare educational and financial documents for submission. Upon approval, they receive a selection certificate, undergo background and medical checks, and prepare for a new journey in a new land!
