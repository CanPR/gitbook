# Manitoba

**Overview**

Manitoba offers a vibrant lifestyle with abundant work opportunities and a low unemployment rate, making it an attractive destination for skilled workers. The Manitoba Provincial Nominee Program (MPNP) aims to address the labor market needs by welcoming skilled workers from abroad who possess the required experience and talent sought by businesses in the region. It also extends residency opportunities to individuals with previous work or study experience in Manitoba.

All applicants must meet the minimum requirements for age, education, work experience, language proficiency, etc., and submit an Expression of Interest (EOI). Successful candidates will receive an invitation to apply, following which they must submit relevant documents and apply for Canadian permanent residence.

Successful candidates can immigrate to Manitoba, Canada, and embark on a secure and stable career path.

**Who Can Apply**

* Candidates living abroad with work experience and skills relevant to Manitoba's labor market needs
* Candidates with previous work or study experience in Manitoba who meet general requirements
* Skilled candidates with close family or friends in Manitoba

**How Long it Takes**

It takes approximately 6 to 12 months to receive a nomination and an additional 6 to 8 months for processing the Permanent Residency application.

**How It Works**

Candidates interested in Manitoba PNP residency must first submit an Expression of Interest (EOI). They will be assessed based on various factors, including age, work experience, skill set, occupation, and language proficiency. Applicants are ranked against other candidates in the pool, and those with the highest scores receive a Letter of Advice to apply.

Recipients of a Letter of Advice can then submit a complete application for permanent residence with the required documents. Upon completion of processing, which typically takes 4 to 6 months, successful candidates will receive a Canadian visa and can migrate to Manitoba, Canada.

This process applies to individuals with prior work or study experience in Manitoba and skilled workers from countries other than Canada.

**In-Demand NOC Occupations Lists**

Manitoba offers an Express Entry-aligned stream known as the Manitoba Express Entry pathway, where candidates do not require a job offer to be eligible. However, having close friends or relatives residing in Manitoba increases the chances of receiving an invitation to apply.

For French-speaking candidates, eligibility is possible even if their work experience is not listed in the in-demand occupations list.

The Morden's Community Driven Immigration Initiative (MCDII) targets the following in-demand jobs:

* Welders
* Early Childhood Educators (children less than 5 years old)
* Manufacturing Supervisors
* Food Service Supervisors (fast food)
* Construction Managers
* Carpenters
* Painters and Decorators (Painter in manufacturing or construction setting)
* Cooks
