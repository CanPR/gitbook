# Nova Scotia

**Overview**

Nova Scotia offers abundant opportunities for Canada permanent residence applicants. The province has various streams open for skilled workers, including the Nova Scotia Skilled Labour Market Priorities, Physicians, Entrepreneurs, International Graduate Entrepreneurs, Skilled Workers, Demand Express Entry, and Experience Express Entry.

Each stream has its own process and timeline, typically taking three months or more. Candidates create and process their profiles, and if chosen, they receive a Nominee Certificate. Subsequently, they must submit a Nova Scotia PR application to Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada within six months. Applicants undergo thorough background, criminal, and medical checks, and possibly an interview.

After approval, candidates embark on their journey to scenic Nova Scotia for a fresh start.

**Who Can Apply**

* Candidates with a valid job offer from a Canadian employer
* Candidates selected for Nova Scotia PR through Express Entry
* Candidates who have worked in Nova Scotia for one year in a highly demanded occupation
* Candidates in highly demanded occupations who are easily employable

**How Long it Takes**

Approximately three months or more, depending on the stream.

**How It Works**

To migrate to Nova Scotia, candidates must qualify for one of the streams:

* **Nova Scotia Labour Market Priorities**: Express Entry candidates nominated by Nova Scotia based on labour market needs receive a Letter of Interest and must submit documents for verification. If approved, they receive a selection certificate and apply for Nova Scotia PR.
* **Skilled Workers**: Professionals with a full-time job offer from a Canadian employer in the area can apply for Canada Permanent Residence. They must have an Express Entry profile, one year of work experience in the offered occupation, financial resources, language fluency, and equivalent education.
* **Demand: Express Entry**: Skilled workers in occupations in demand who have an Express Entry profile and occupation listed on the Demand: Express Entry guide.
* **Experience: Express Entry**: Workers with at least one year of experience in a high-skilled occupation in Nova Scotia.
