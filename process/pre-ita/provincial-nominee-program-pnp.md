# Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)

The Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) offers an alternative for those who feel their Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score falls short. It is an immigration initiative managed by provincial and territorial governments to select candidates deemed suitable to meet the specific needs of their region.

Some provinces require a full-time job offer from a Canadian Employer and some donâ€™t. Some provinces process the applications electronically and some provinces still use a paper mail method. Some provinces prefer applicants whose job falls under a particular NOC.  &#x20;

If you get a provincial nomination, it will add 600 points to your CRS which means, in most cases, you will get an ITA in the very next draw.

If you have a CRS score below 410, you have no option but to go for PNPs.
