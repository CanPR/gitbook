# Proof of Funds (POF)

Proof of funds (POF) is a very important part of your documentation. You must show that you have enough money to settle in Canada

_**How much money will you need?**_

The amount of money you need to support your family is set by the size of your family. The minimum amount of funds required is mentioned in the link below:

While you are awaiting your ITA, you can prepare to show your funds. You DO NOT need to get any bank letter/document at this stage but if you need to arrange funds (Like selling a car or liquidating assets such as selling gold), you have to start planning how you are going to show your funds.

CIC requires that the funds be unencumbered by any debt or obligation to repay. These funds must be liquid (You should be able to convert it to hard cash whenever required). You can see what CIC allows you to show as POF in the link provided above.

It could be FD (six months old minimum), bank account statement along with balance certificate from the bank (stating the date of account opening, current balance, the average balance of six months and total money’s worth in Canadian dollars, your name and address).

If all of the information could not be provided on one bank certificate, get a signed and stamped account statement from the bank to support the bank certificate.
