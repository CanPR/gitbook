# Proficiency in French

TEF (Test d’évaluation de français) is a valid French proficiency test which earns you very few points in your total CRS table.

Scoring the maximum CLB 10 (Advanced) level score will earn you a total of 24 points.

To reach that level of CLB 10, you need to clear at least A1, A2 and B1 which takes approximately a year and needs lots of practice because the language is not easy.

If you want to improve your CRS, take IELTS coaching classes and try to improve bands if possible. That will give you a huge boost as IELTS covers way more points than TEF.
