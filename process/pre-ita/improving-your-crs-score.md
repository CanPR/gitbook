# Improving your CRS Score

**Include your spouse’s language test scores if you are married.**&#x20;

Although it may be beneficial to apply as an individual, including your spouses language test scores and academic credentials can help improve your own CRS score.

Consider having your spouse apply as the primary candidate instead of you. Assess both of your credentials and try to estimate which partner would receive the higher CRS score.\


**Apply for a Provincial Nomination.**

Each province or territory will have its requirements for provincial nominee applicants. Contact the local government in the province you wish to be nominated by to begin the application process. Getting a sponsorship will earn you 600 additional points, with the maximum CRS score reaching 1200 points.

You can only apply for a provincial nomination in the province or territory where you intend to live.

Along with meeting the requirements for the specific provincial nomination that you apply for, you will also have to qualify for one of the federal immigration programs that Express Entry supports.\


**Earn a Bachelors, Masters, or Doctoral degree.**

Although it can be costly and time-consuming, the more education you receive the more points you’ll earn through CRS. Consider going to school in Canada to familiarize yourself with the country and to avoid the need to get an ECA.

Although having any level of education is useful, more advanced degrees will earn you more points.

Some colleges allow students to begin earning a Master's degree at the same time as they pursue their Bachelor's degree. Plan to apply for this program early if your school offers it.\


**Increase your job experience.**

The more time you spend at one job, the more points you will earn. Focus on getting promoted to an advanced position at your current job to further boost your CRS score. Consider getting a job in Canada to increase your score further.

Remember to record any job or career changes on your Express Entry profile.\


**Become fluent in both French and English.**

If you can learn both French and English, you should take a second language test to earn a higher CRS score. Remember that you have to reach a certain threshold for your test scores to count toward your overall profile score.

If you can, plan to study French or English in school to become fluent by the time you hope to apply for Express Entry.
