# AIPP (Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program)

1.  **About the process**\
    \
    The Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program is a partnership between the Government of Canada and the 4 Atlantic provinces:

    * New Brunswick
    * Newfoundland and Labrador
    * Nova Scotia
    * Prince Edward Island\


    The Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program lets Atlantic employers hire qualified candidates for jobs that they haven't been able to fill locally.\
    \
    You can be living abroad or be in Canada temporarily. You must have a job offer before you can apply.\


    If you and the employer meet the requirements, you'll get permanent resident status.\

2.  **Eligibility requirements**\
    \
    Employers can hire you through 1 of 3 programs in the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program:

    * Atlantic High-Skilled Program
    * Atlantic Intermediate-Skilled Program
    * Atlantic International Graduate Program\


    _Each program has its requirements. These requirements cover:_

    * The job that you’ll have in the Atlantic province
    * Your skills, experience and education
    * Your ability to communicate in English or French
    * Your ability to support yourself and your family in Canada
    * Your intent to reside in the Atlantic province\

3. **Get your documents ready before your job offer**\
   \
   Prior to receiving a job offer, it's essential to gather and submit the necessary documents along with your application. Obtaining these documents beforehand enables you to expedite the application process once you secure a job offer.
   * Language
   * Education
   * Proof of funds\

4. **Find a designated employer**\
   \
   The Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program doesn’t match you with open jobs. An employer has to offer you a job before you can apply.\
   \
   If an employer wants to hire you, make sure they are designated by the province where you’ll be working. Ask to see the _Confirmation of Designation_ from the province where you'll be working.\

5.  **Get a job offer**\
    \
    When presented with a job offer from an employer in the Atlantic region, ensure that it aligns with the eligibility criteria of the program you are eligible for.\


    Upon receiving the offer, you will be provided with an Offer of Employment to a Foreign National \[IMM 5650] form by the employer. It is crucial to sign this form and retain a copy, as it will be necessary for your settlement plan.\


    It is imperative to meet the employment prerequisites specified for the offered position, which are outlined in the National Occupational Classification. Your previous job experiences need not necessarily match the field of the offered position.\

6. **Get a settlement plan**\
   \
   After you get a job offer from a designated employer, you and any family members who are aged 18 years and over and who will be living with you in Canada need to get a settlement plan.\
   \
   The plan will:
   * Help you settle in Canada
   * Give you resources and links related to you and your family’s needs
   * Tell you where you can go in the community to get help\

7. **Get endorsed by an Atlantic province**\
   \
   After you have your settlement plan, the province must endorse the job offer. Your employer will handle this process. Don’t submit your permanent residence application until you’ve been endorsed.\
   \
   If the province endorses your job offer, you’ll get a Certificate of Endorsement in the mail. Include your endorsement certificate with your permanent residence application.\
   \
   The endorsement application:
   * Your employer will fill out and submit an endorsement application to the province. This will include a copy of your settlement plan.
   * Each province has its own process. Your employer may need more documents from you. You may also have to sign some forms.
   * Since the provinces handle endorsement, send any questions to them. IRCC isn’t involved in this step.
