# Awaiting your ITA

This is a phase where you have created an online profile and you are waiting to get your Invitation to Apply (hereafter referred to as ITA).

Roughly speaking, CIC conducts draws twice a month. The Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration decides the cut-off score for the particular draw. You can see the rounds of invitations in the Statistics tab in the app.

If your score is greater than or equal to the cut-off score selected by CIC, you will get an ITA. One thing that youâ€™ll have to do here is to keep an eye on the draws and your CRS. You have to see how close you are to the previous/recent draws.
