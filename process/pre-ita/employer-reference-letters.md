# Employer Reference Letters

**Employer Reference letters are required for any applicant claiming points for their Work Experience. The reference letter must be as specified by CIC.**

1. Make a job reference letter wherein you mention all your duties as an employee of the company. These duties must match the NOC chosen by you. Refer link of NOC to check what duties fall under what NOC.
2. Other information to be included in this letter:
   * Designation
   * Number of hours you work every week, full time/part time
   * Monthly salary and other benefits
   * Date of joining and or leaving the job (if you have worked for multiple companies).
3. This letter is to be printed on company letterhead and signed by your immediate boss or an HR Representative and must include a contact number.
4. If your boss has left the job or the company has been closed, or the boss refuses to sign, then any other senior person (your colleague) can sign it, provided he works/worked with you. In this case, get an affidavit signed by that person stating that this information is true to the best of his knowledge and understanding.
5. Upload the scanned copy of this letter along with your appointment letter (if available), pay slips (last 6 months), and IT Return copies in the link provided under the job reference document in your e-APR.

<summary>TIPS</summary>

* Depending on where the applicant works, the time taken for employers to issue these reference letters vary. So, it is important to be prepared and apply for the reference letter at the earliest convenience.
* Please note that reference letters issued by employers after you quit a job are valid indefinitely while the reference letters issued by your current employer are generally valid for one year.
* CIC might sometimes choose to call your employer to verify your employment history if they feel they need to verify.
