# Educational Credential Assessment (ESA)

After you book your IELTS, during the period between your date of booking the test and date of examination, it is better to apply for your Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) to save time.

_**NOTE:** Without a valid ECA an express entry profile cannot be created._

World Education Services (WES) is one of the most tried and tested organizations to get your ECA done. Other organizations, like IQAS, ICES, etc., who provide an ECA are listed here:

2. Feed your details as instructed.
3. Choose document by document evaluation (ECA for CIC).
4. Ensure to have a card which allows you to make international payments, in case you are not in Canada.
5. Pay the fees ($200 for application + shipping fees of $7 standard or $33 express for courier through which a report will be sent to your address). The total cost would be a maximum of $233 CAD.  \
   You can add as many degrees, certificates and diplomas you have done for evaluation within these $233.
6. Once you pay the fees, you will get your application number which is usually 7 digits long.
7. Download the “Academic Records Request Form” from the WES website. It is available in the “Required Documents” section. &#x20;
8. Identify which documents are required for your degree/diploma.
9. Fill out the first half of your academic records request form yourself. The form is editable, fill it out on a PC and then get it printed. Finally, sign it. Do not touch the second half of the form. &#x20;
10. The University will require you to courier the documents directly to WES.

_**NOTE:** WES does not evaluate trade certificate education (e.g. ITI or two/three months software courses from private tutors like Jetking or NIIT)._
