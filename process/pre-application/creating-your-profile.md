# Creating your Profile

To create your online Express Entry profile, you will need a couple of things:

1. You need to create My CIC account if you do not have one already. &#x20;
2. You will need your Passport, Degrees, Marksheets, Work Contract Documents (for the start and end date of the job), Language test Test Report Form (hereafter referred to as TRF) number AND your ECA report number to create and submit a complete profile. &#x20;
3. You may register with Canada’s “Job Bank”.

Now you have to sit down patiently and wait for your ITA. The odds of getting an ITA are directly proportional to your CRS. The higher your CRS, the higher the chances of getting invited.   &#x20;

When you have those in hand you can create your express entry profile:

Register to the Job Bank:

You will be given points based on your age, education, number of years of work experience, and language skills.

The points system is detailed here

You will be in a pool with thousands of other applicants:

Of course, the more points you have the better. The max is 1200, with 600 of those points coming from your ability to snag a PNP or a job offer with a very hard-to-get Labour Market Impact Assessment:

For CEC applicants, the maximum points is 600 but someone who has no work experience in Canada and who is only eligible for FSW can only get up to 520 points.
