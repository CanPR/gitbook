If you create an account under WES, and if your university is listed in their system, it is more likely to be considered by the other assessing providers.

Alternative options are CES, ICES, ICAS, IQAS. Unlike WES, other providers will not get a list of universities that are already approved.

Sometimes, the highest credentials alone are enough to get the highest points for the Express Entry Program. In the case of a Provincial Program, requirements change and hence you may need to get both degrees assessed. So, it is always advisable to go through the PNP requirement.
