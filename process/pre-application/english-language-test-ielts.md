# English Language Test - IELTS

You can book your IELTS exam (General Module) from one of the following governing bodies: &#x20;

* IDP Education
* British Council

If both husband and wife are applying for Visa, both must appear in IELTS and secure the minimum score as prescribed by Canadian Immigration and Citizenship (CIC) under the Federal skilled worker visa program (FSWP) which is 6 in each band, i.e. Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking.

For preparation, one needs to study material published and distributed by “Cambridge IELTS”.

Alternatively, join coaching class near your house as per your convenience. You may also get a book for preparation from the agency you chose to appear in IELTS viz. IDP or British Council.

Result of your IELTS Exam shall be declared after 13 days of your date of the test.

For Canadian Immigration practical scores required are 8 in listening (minimum 35 Correct answers out of 40), 7 in Reading (minimum 30-32 Correct answers out of 40), and 7 each in writing and speaking.

This score in the IELTS exam will fetch you CLB 9 for Canadian Immigration (CLB means Canadian Language Benchmark). You may qualify for Canadian immigration with as low as 6 bands each (LRWS). However, anything less than CLB 9 scores and your overall score for immigration called CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) score would be too low for you to receive an invitation.
