# Determining Eligibility

**To apply to Express Entry, you must satisfy certain criteria. You should be eligible under one of the Economic Immigration programs:**

1. Federal Skilled Worker Program \[FSW]
   * Most pursued category.
   * Need to score at least 67 points out of a total of 100 to be eligible.
   * You can calculate your points based on the criteria outlined on the CIC webpage. (Check the Useful Links section in the Goodies tab of the app).
2. Federal Skilled Trades \[FST]
3. Canadian Experience Class \[CEC]. &#x20;

**The basic eligibility criteria are as follows:**

1. You need to have your language test results ready (English or French). \
   \
   You must get at least CLB 7 in each of the four sections for the Federal Skilled Worker (FSW), Provincial Nomination Program (PNP) or Canadian Experience Class (CEC) streams but getting CLB 10 gives you maximum points for language.  \
   \
   How does CLB match back to the language tests?&#x20;
