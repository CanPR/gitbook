# Obtaining Proof of Education

**Follow the steps below:**

1. Get a letter from the college you attended stating that you were a student of this college from a certain batch, having passed all your degrees/diploma exams.
2. Get copies of your mark sheets and degree certificate attested from your college. It would be handy to keep extra copies of your degree and mark sheets with you.
3. Now go to your university, with attested and unattested copies of mark sheets, as well as degree certificate along with half-filled “Academic records, request form.
4. At your University, get the lower half of the Academic records to request a form filled by the authorized person, preferably from the office of the Controller of Examinations or Registrars.
5. Get your mark sheets and Degree certificates attested by your university. If they want you to get these documents attested from your college first, then show them the copies you got attested from your college. In this way, you will be able to save time wasted in going back to your college, getting your mark sheets and degree copies attested from college and coming back to university.
6. Finally, your university will take money from you and pack all the documents to be sent to WES directly by them. Alternatively, they will pack all the documents in their official envelope, signed, sealed and stamped. When they will hand over this to you, you can then send this to WES Canada yourself through a registered post or courier.

_**NOTE:** If WES requires any further documents they will send you an email. Make sure you provide your correct email ID while applying for ECA at the WES website._
