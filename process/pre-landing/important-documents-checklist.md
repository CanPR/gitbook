# Important Documents Checklist

For your first-time landing formalities, there are certain documents you must have at immigration. You may also need many of the other documents listed below at a later date or you might not need them at all but it's best to carry whatever you have with you. &#x20;

**Essential documents checklist needed for immigration:**

* [ ] A Canadian immigrant visa and Confirmation of Permanent Residence for each family member travelling with you. (If dependents are not travelling with you carry photocopies of their visas and COPR)
* [ ] A valid passport for each family member travelling with you
* [ ] Two copies of a list of all the personal or household items you are bringing with you (Explained in detail later)
* [ ] Two copies of a list of items that will follow. (If you want to ship your goods at a later date after you arrive in Canada, as new immigrants if you were to present this list during your first time landing you don't pay any customs or taxes on it. This is only a one-time advantage for goods shipped at a later date. The only exception to this is Jewelry. You need to mention any jewelry in this list that you will be carrying with you in your second visit to avoid duties and customs on it)
* [ ] CBSA declaration card (You will get this on the plane)
* [ ] Proof of funds (Explained in detail later in the document) &#x20;
* [ ] SIN Apps Form (NAS 2120) - Not Needed at the Airport \[Can be done later at Services Canada] &#x20;

<summary>TIPS</summary>

* Copy and paste both checklists into your own document system (Word, iNotes, or another organizing file), so that you can keep track of your required documents.&#x20;
* All important documents must be translated into English or French (Depending on where you are moving) before arriving to make it easier for people in Canada to understand them.
* Do not pack these documents in your luggage. Keep them with you at all times.
* Photocopies of all essential and important documents are necessary, in case the originals get lost (be sure to keep the photocopies in a separate place from the originals).
*   Do not laminate your documents. There are reports of some laminated documents not being accepted.



    _**NOTE**: The more you are organized before hand, the better 1st impression you deliver with the IO/CBSA officer. This will help you get through faster._
