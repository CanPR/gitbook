**Limitation and Requirements:**

* There is no upper limit on the funds you can carry as long as you can prove their legitimate source and declare amounts equal to or exceeding $10,000 CAD, as per CBSA regulations.
* However, there is a minimum requirement based on the number of family members accompanying you, as outlined by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC).

**Minimum Funds Requirement:**
