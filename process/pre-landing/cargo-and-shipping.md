# Cargo and Shipping

**Using Cargo and Shipping Services for Additional Luggage:**

After your arrival in Canada, you have the option to utilize various cargo and shipping services to send additional luggage. This can be particularly useful if you have excess belongings that cannot be accommodated during your initial travel.

**Important Note:**

When sending additional luggage through cargo or shipping services, it's essential to add these items to your "goods to follow" list. By including them in this list, you can retrieve them later without incurring extra charges or customs duties. This ensures a seamless process for receiving your additional belongings after your arrival in Canada.

**Additional Information:**

* **Goods to Follow List:** In accordance with Canadian customs regulations, travelers are required to declare all goods they are bringing into the country, including items sent through cargo or shipping services. By listing these items in the "goods to follow" section of your customs declaration, you can avoid complications and additional fees when retrieving them later.
* **Customs Declaration:** When completing your customs declaration upon arrival in Canada, be sure to accurately list all items you are bringing into the country, including those sent via cargo or shipping services. Failure to declare goods properly can result in delays, fines, or other consequences.
* **Customs Regulations:** Familiarize yourself with Canadian customs regulations regarding the importation of goods, including any restrictions or prohibitions on certain items. This knowledge will help ensure compliance with Canadian laws and regulations when sending additional luggage through cargo or shipping services.
