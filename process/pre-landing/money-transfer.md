**Transferring Settlement Funds to Canada**

The most efficient method is to open a bank account in Canada and transfer the settlement funds through Telegraphic Transfer (TT) in one transaction, minimizing banking fees and conversion charges. This account, known as a deposit account, can only be opened after receiving the Confirmation of Permanent Residence (CoPR). It allows for depositing funds but does not permit withdrawals before landing in Canada. Upon visiting the preferred bank's branch, the deposit account can be converted into any desired type of bank account.
