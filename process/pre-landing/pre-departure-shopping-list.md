# Pre-departure Shopping List

**Packing Considerations**

Before packing for your move to Canada, it's essential to consider the cost and practicality of bringing extra baggage. Many items are readily available in Canada at reasonable prices, and certain items may not be permitted entry due to quality, quantity restrictions, or specific regulations outlined by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). It's advisable to check the CBSA website for more information on restricted items.

**What to Bring:**

1. **Personal Effects:** Bring items for immediate use, but avoid packing in large quantities.
2. **General Clothing:** Include some warm clothing, although it's recommended to purchase winter clothing in Canada.
