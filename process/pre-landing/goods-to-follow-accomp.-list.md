**2. Listing Procedure:**

* Use form BSF186 for both "Goods Accompanying" (those with you) and "Goods to Follow" (those arriving later).
* Group similar items together to simplify the listing process.
* Each group should include items of the same category (e.g., electronics, jewelry, clothing).
* For jewelry items, create separate groups for each type of jewelry (e.g., rings, necklaces) and include detailed descriptions and photographs of each item.

**3. Creating Excel Sheets (Complementary Documents):**

* Create separate Excel sheets for each group of items.
* Label each sheet with a title indicating the group (e.g., "Electronics," "Clothing").
* Within each sheet, list the items with their descriptions, quantities, and values in Canadian dollars (CAD).
* For jewelry items, include columns for each piece's description, quantity, and value, along with a column for attaching photographs of each item.

**4. Filling out Forms BSF186 and BSF186A:**

* **Step 1: Grouping and Listing**
  * Fill out form BSF186 by transferring information from the Excel sheets.
  * Enter the total value of each group of items into the appropriate section of the form.
  * Ensure all jewelry items are individually listed with descriptions and values, accompanied by photographs.
* **Step 2: Completing Form Details**
  * Write your name in the designated field.
  * Provide your Canadian address as the importer's address.
  * Enter your home country's name as the country of export.
  * Tick the "Goods to Follow" box if applicable.
  * On page 2 of form BSF186, tick the "Newcomer" box.
  * Sign and date the form at the bottom, indicating the day of your arrival and the name of the point of entry (POE).

**5. Final Steps:**

* Print two copies of forms BSF186 and BSF186A (if applicable) on regular A4 paper.
* Have one copy of each form stamped, signed, and dated by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) at the point of entry.
* Print and staple all corresponding Excel sheets to their respective forms.

**6. Submission and Retention:**

* Submit one copy of each form to CBSA for customs clearance.
* Retain the other copy of each form for your records.

<summary>TIPS</summary>

**Tips for Filing Forms and Declaring Goods:**

1. **Tax-Free Landing Goods:**
   * Goods purchased specifically for your initial landing in Canada are non-taxed.
2. **Stamping at First Landing:**
   * If you plan to bring goods later, whether personally or through a transporter, ensure that the list is stamped during your first landing.
   * Failure to do so may result in those goods being subject to duties upon entry.
   * No exceptions are made in this regard.
3. **Documentation Essentials:**
   * Remember to take two printouts of each form and its attachments.
   * One copy will be retained by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).
4. **Jewelry Documentation:**
   * It is crucial to take photographs of all jewelry items.
   * Failure to provide photographic evidence may lead to rejection by customs authorities.
5. **Stamping on Landing:**
   * Even if not explicitly requested by the Border Services Officer (BSO), insist on having your forms stamped upon landing.
   * This ensures compliance and avoids potential complications later on.
6. **Additional Information:**
   * In cases where documentation is incomplete, the CBSA may request further action such as obtaining a stamp via email or visiting the airport the following day.
   * Although possible, this process can lead to unnecessary hassles and consume additional time and effort.
