**Tips for Finding Good Flight Fares**

Finding the best flight fares requires strategic planning and careful consideration of various factors. Here are some tips to help you identify good fares:

1. **Book on Tuesday:**
   * The optimal time to book a U.S./North American flight is typically Tuesday at around 3 p.m. Eastern Time. Airlines often release weekly airfare sales early on Tuesday mornings, and by mid-afternoon, competing airlines have matched these sale prices, providing you with a wide range of deals to choose from.
2. **Keep Your Searches Confidential:**
   * Flight prices may increase if a particular route is repeatedly searched, as websites aim to create urgency for booking. To avoid potential price hikes, always conduct flight searches in incognito or private browsing mode to view the lowest prices without cookies influencing the results.&#x20;
3. **Use Reliable Fare Aggregators:**
   * Consider using reputable fare aggregators like:
     * [Momondo.c](https://www.momondo.ca/?ispredir=true)[a](https://www.momondo.ca/): Offers comprehensive fare comparison and flexible search options.
     * [Skyscanner.c](https://www.skyscanner.ca/)[a](https://www.skyscanner.ca/): Provides extensive search capabilities, although it may not include all airline connections.
     * [Airfarewatchdog.com](https://www.airfarewatchdog.com/), [Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com/en/), [Airwander.com](https://airwander.com/): Other reliable options for finding competitive fares.
     * [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights): Offers detailed flight timings and schedules for comparison, although prices may not always be the most competitive.
     * [Secretflying.com](https://www.secretflying.com/): A valuable resource for discovering exceptional deals.
4. **Know When to Purchase:**
   * Deciding when to finalize your flight booking can be challenging. Websites like [Kayak.com](https://www.ca.kayak.com/) offer fare predictions for major cities, helping you determine whether to book immediately or wait for potential fare decreases. "The Hopper" app also tracks itineraries and notifies you of fare drops, aiding in your decision-making process. You can download Hopper [here](https://hopper.com/download).
   * Many airlines launch fare sales on Tuesdays, so purchasing on a Monday may result in missed opportunities if prices drop the following day.

**Additional Tips:**

* **Timing of Purchase:** Trends suggest that the optimal time to buy tickets is typically 5-7 weeks before the travel date.
* **Patience and Persistence:** With a combination of the above tips, along with patience and effort, you can consistently find good deals even during peak travel periods.

By following these tips and staying informed about fare trends, you can enhance your chances of securing competitive flight fares for their journeys.

**Before Travel:**

1. **Pack According to Airline Guidelines:**
   * Ensure your luggage dimensions and weight comply with airline guidelines to avoid additional fees or issues during check-in.
2. **Prepare Hand Baggage Essentials:**
   * Keep essential clothes and daily items in your hand baggage, following airline regulations. This ensures you can manage for a day or two in case of luggage delay (approximately 1 in 500 people experience this).
3. **Keep Hand Baggage Light:**
   * Keep your hand baggage light as you'll need to carry it between transit gates during your journey.

**During Travel:**

1. **Secure Boarding Passes:**
   * Hold onto your boarding passes, especially the one with stickers/chits containing details of your checked-in luggage.
2. **Carry Local Currency for Transit:**
   * Have local currency on hand for food and water during transit, as paying with cards may incur higher costs. Note that some airports have limited drinking water facilities.
3. **Be Cautious with In-flight Food:**
   * Taste a small portion of in-flight food before consuming, as some people may not tolerate certain items like cheese and butter well. Avoid items you're uncomfortable with, as it may be a while before you can disembark.
4. **Check Transit Visa Requirements:**
   * Check if you need a transit visa for your connecting flight. Visit the provided link for transit visa information for the UK.
