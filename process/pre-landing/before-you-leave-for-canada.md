# Before You Leave For Canada

**When should you complete the landing process?**

Upon receiving the Permanent Resident (PR) visa, the 'record of landing' must be completed on or before the Visa Expiry Date as indicated on the visa.

The Visa Expiry Date is determined by either:

1. One year from the date of medical examination, or&#x20;
2. The passport expiry date of the Principal Applicant (PA) or any accompanying dependents, whichever is earlier.

**Who should initiate the landing process?**

The Principal Applicant (PA) bears the responsibility of completing the landing process first, which may include accompanying one or more family members.

_**NOTE:** The dependents of the PA are not permitted to complete the landing process before the PA._
