# Getting a Driving License

**Driver's Licensing Process in Ontario**

_**NOTE:** The process outlined below is specific to Ontario. Other provinces may have variations in their procedures. You can find additional information for each province using the link in the "LINKS" section._

**G1 Licence:**

* The initial car license in Ontario is the G1, obtained through a written test and an eye test.
* A G license holder must accompany the G1 driver while driving on city roads only; highway driving is not permitted.
* Only a G license holder is allowed in the front seat while the G1 driver is operating the vehicle.
* There must be a blood alcohol level of 0 for the G1 driver.
* G1 holders are not permitted to purchase a car.

**G2 Licence:**

* After one year (or 8 months if completing an Approved Drivers Training Course) of practice and passing a G1 road test, the G2 license is obtained.
* With a G2 license, the driver can drive alone on any Ontario roads.
* The blood alcohol level of a G2 driver must still be 0.
* All passengers must wear seat belts.
* The number of passengers must not exceed the number of working seat belts in the car.
* Insurance rates for G2 holders are typically higher compared to G holders, although first-year insurance may be lower due to government subsidies.

**G Licence:**

* After one additional year of practice, the full G license (also known as the FULL LICENSE) is obtained through a more intensive road test.
* With the G License, drivers have more privileges and can drive almost anywhere, with or without passengers.
* Blood alcohol level must be within legal limits (below 0.8 at all times).
* If caught with a blood alcohol level between 0.5 and 0.8, provisional penalties apply.

**Additional Information:**

* Individuals with an Indian driving license (DL EXTRACT) or 'PARTICULAR OF DRIVING LICENSE' can obtain their G1 license immediately after passing the written test.
* They can then progress to the G license by passing a G2 road test as soon as it can be scheduled.
* Failing the G road test for the first time requires passing the G2 test before attempting the G road test again, with no specific time limit (except the original validity of the G1 license).
* Both road tests can be scheduled as soon as the driver feels confident, with a 10-day waiting period between reattempts for G/G2 tests.
