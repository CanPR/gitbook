# Making the Payment

**Payment Process and Application Submission**

* After uploading all the required documents as specified by CIC, a link will be activated at the bottom of the page, prompting you to proceed with fee payment.
* If you opt to pay only the application fee, the amount will be $550 CAD per applicant. Alternatively, if you initially selected to include the Right of Permanent Residence Fee (RPRF), the total payment will be $550 + $490 CAD per applicant. Effective April 30th, 2020, these fees will increase to $825 and $500, respectively.
* Once the payment is completed, CIC will issue an Acknowledgement of Receipt (AOR), signalling that your application has been successfully submitted, and the processing phase has commenced. A payment receipt will also be provided for your records.
