# Medical Examination

You must pass a medical examination before coming to Canada. Your dependents must also pass a medical examination, even if they are not accompanying you.

***

**Health Requirements for Permanent Residence:**

Applications for permanent residence will not be accepted if that person’s health:

* Is a danger to public health or safety, or
* Would cause excessive demand on health or social services in Canada.

***

**How to Apply:**

Instructions on how to take the medical examination will normally be sent to you after you submit your application to the visa office.

***

**Validity:**

You can only use your examination results in your application for 12 months from when you had the examination. If you are not admitted to Canada as a permanent resident within this time, you will be required to undergo another examination.

***

**Authorized Physicians:**

Your own doctor cannot perform the medical examination. You must see a physician on Canada’s list of Designated Medical Practitioners.&#x20;

***

**Medical Report Procedures:**

Medical reports and x-rays for the medical examination become the property of the Canadian Immigration Medical Authorities and cannot be returned to you.

Pregnant applicants or applicants can choose to complete their medical exam after the baby is born (since chest X-ray is a part of the tests) OR can choose to go ahead with the tests by wearing a lead apron.

***

**Results and Final Decision:**

The doctor will not tell you the results of the medical examination. The doctor will let you know if you have a health-related problem.

The designated medical practitioner does not make the final decision. Citizenship and Immigration Canada will make the final decision on whether or not you have passed your medical examination for immigration purposes.

The visa office will tell you in writing if there is a problem with your medical examination.

<summary>TIPS</summary>

* Many CIC approved Hospitals/Clinics have a long wait list. Book an appointment as soon as you receive your ITA to avoid a last minute delay.
* Your PR Visa expires 1 year after your medical approved date. If you want to have a longer visa validity, you would want to complete your medical examinations as late as possible. Choose which case best applies to you and plan accordingly.
