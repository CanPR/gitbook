# Document Submission

**Post-ITA Documentation**

* All documents listed in the application checklist must be submitted as part of your post-ITA documentation.
* Carefully follow the instructions provided by CIC and complete the online application. Ensure all required documents are uploaded.

**Letter of Explanation (LOE)**

* If there are any unusual circumstances or large recent deposits in your account that need clarification, submit a Letter of Explanation (LOE) along with the documents. This helps the assessing officer understand deviations from prescribed formats or alternative document submissions.

**Reporting Changes**

* Any changes in your circumstances, such as pregnancy of self/spouse, birth of a child, death/divorce, etc., must be reported to the Visa Office (VO) promptly. Failure to report changes may lead to misrepresentation and a 5-year ban on reapplication.

**Processing**

* After submitting your application, your medical records are reviewed. If everything is satisfactory, your application proceeds to processing, including background checks.
* If the VO requires additional information, you may be asked to upload further documents.
* In some cases, you may be required to attend an interview for clarification.
