# Application Processing Timelines

**Processing Timeline and Updates**

* The official timeline for Permanent Residence (PR) processing by CIC is 6 months. However, current trends indicate an average processing time of 5 - 8 months (150 - 240 days) for the Passport Request (PPR) stage.
* For applications submitted through Express Entry, the typical PR processing timeline ranges from 5 - 8 months (150 - 230/240 days), assuming no issues arise during application review.
* Applications undergoing additional review or security screening may exceed the 5 - 8 month processing window.

**Express Entry Updates:**

1. **Medical Passed:** Typically occurs 30 - 45 days after Acknowledgement of Receipt (AOR), serving as the initial update in your MyCIC Account.
2. **R10 Completeness and A11:** Initial Eligibility Check takes place 45 - 70 days post-AOR at the Centralized Intake Office (CIO), with no changes reflected in your MyCIC Account.
3. **Second Level Eligibility Check by CPC Officer:** Occurs 100 - 150 days post-AOR, also in the backend, without any changes displayed in your MyCIC Account. Verification can be confirmed by contacting the CIC center.
4. **Background and Final Eligibility Check by LVO/Approval Queue/PPR queue by LVO:** Final decision is typically made 140 - 240 days post-AOR, with updates reflected in your MyCIC Account.

Relax and allow the application to progress naturally, while monitoring updates based on the specified timelines for each step mentioned above.
