# After Recieving your ITA

This phase marks the receipt of an Invitation to Apply (ITA), signaling your readiness to submit your application to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). It is a pivotal stage where the fate of your application hinges on acceptance or rejection. Following receipt of an ITA, you have 60 days to file a comprehensive application known as the electronic Application for Permanent Residence (e-APR). \

During this time, it is imperative to gather all required documents and complete a medical test. Once the application is submitted in its entirety, CIC will review and determine visa approval status within 6 months or less. Additionally, Proof of Funds (POF) and reference letters may be obtained post-ITA based on individual circumstances.
