# Obtaining GCMS Notes

**Ordering GCMS Notes**

Ordering GCMS (Global Case Management System) notes is one of the most effective tools to track the status of your application and stay informed about any potential issues.

**What is GCMS?**

GCMS is Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC's) system used to process applications for citizenship and immigration. It contains a detailed record of each applicant's file, including correspondence with IRCC, documents submitted, and notes from reviewing officers.

**Does Ordering GCMS Affect Processing?**

No, ordering GCMS does not slow down or adversely affect your file. In some cases, it can actually help move your file forward as the reviewing officer updates documents received from other agencies.

**Why Not Email or Phone?**

While email and phone inquiries provide limited information, GCMS notes offer an exact copy of your file as it exists in the system, providing a comprehensive overview of your application status.

**How to Order GCMS Notes**

Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and individuals or corporations currently in Canada can order GCMS notes for themselves or others. If not, a third party is required to make the request.

**Processing Time**

Under the Canadian Access to Information and Privacy Act, IRCC must respond to GCMS requests within 30 days, with an average processing time of 40 days due to workload and pending requests.

**Expedited Requests**

There is no way to expedite the process unless litigation is initiated, in which case IRCC will issue GCMS notes within 5 days.

**Reading GCMS Notes**

While initially confusing, understanding the stages of a case file's processing helps interpret GCMS notes. The typical stages include Completeness Check, R10 Review, Eligibility, and Security.

**Best Time to Order**

Order GCMS notes after the R10 Review stage, usually within the first month of application submission, to ensure completeness before requesting GCMS notes.
