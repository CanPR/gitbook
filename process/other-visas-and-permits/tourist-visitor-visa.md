# Tourist (Visitor) Visa

The Canada Visitor Visa, a Temporary Resident Visa, enables individuals to visit Canada for tourism or family purposes. Upon arrival at a Canadian port of entry, Border Patrol Officers assess the traveler's documents and situation to grant or deny entry.

Most travelers require a Visitor visa for entry, though some nationals may only need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or may be exempt from visa requirements.
