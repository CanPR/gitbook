# Student Visa

**Overview**

To study in Canada, obtaining a Canadian study permit is necessary, acting as a student visa for the duration of your stay. A permit isn't required for programs lasting six months or less, but it's advisable to apply beforehand to facilitate potential program extensions or changes.

With a Canadian study permit, you can also work part-time on campus as a full-time registered student and may be eligible for off-campus work, co-op programs, permanent residency, or post-graduation employment.

**Applying for a Canadian Study Permit**

Applications can be submitted online or via paper forms, with online submissions generally processed faster. Applicants must obtain a standardized letter of acceptance from a recognized institution and, if applicable, a certificate of acceptance from the Quebec government.

The application process involves completing forms, obtaining necessary documents, answering eligibility questions, receiving a personal checklist code, creating a MyCIC account, uploading documents, paying fees, and possibly attending an interview.

**Additional Canadian Student Visa Requirements**

Additional requirements may include providing biometrics, undergoing a medical exam and/or police check, possessing a valid passport, and proving financial support. The current requirement is CA$10,000 (\~US$7,650) per year (CA$11,000/\~US$8,400 for Quebec) plus sufficient funds for transportation.

**Next Steps After Applying**

Upon approval, applicants receive a Port of Entry (POE) Letter of Introduction or Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) if required. The eTA, valid for up to five years, must be presented alongside the passport used during the application process to gain entry into Canada.

Travelers should provide these documents, along with proof of finances and acceptance, to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) for issuance of the Canadian study permit and entry into the country.
