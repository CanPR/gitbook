# Work Permit

**Overview**

Obtaining a Canadian temporary work permit involves a multi-step process that typically takes several weeks. Various factors such as nationality, occupation, and intended work in Canada can influence the process and the possibility of expediting it.

**Canadian Temporary Work Visa**

To secure a temporary work permit, Canadian employers must obtain approval from Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) or an Offer of Employment number from Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). Depending on their citizenship, foreign workers may also need a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) to enter Canada.

**Steps to Apply for a Canadian Work Permit**

**Step 1:** Employer applies for a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA), if necessary. This assessment determines if there are Canadian citizens or permanent residents available to fill the job.

**Step 2:** Employer extends a Temporary Job Offer. Once the LMIA is approved, the employer provides a copy of the approval letter and a detailed job offer letter to the foreign worker.

**Step 3:** Foreign Worker applies for a Work Permit. With the required documents, including the LMIA approval letter and job offer letter, the foreign worker submits an application for a Canadian temporary work permit to IRCC. Depending on their nationality, they may also need a TRV to enter Canada.

**Step 4:** Work Permit is issued. Upon arrival in Canada, the temporary work permit is issued by a Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer at the point of entry. Work permits can be issued for various durations, from a few days to several years, and are typically employer-specific.

**Additional Information**

* Work permits are usually employer-specific, meaning the foreign worker can only work for the specified employer.
* If a foreign worker wishes to change employers or positions in Canada, they must apply for and receive a new work permit.
* Some situations may allow foreign workers to obtain a work permit without an LMIA, known as LMIA Exempt Work Permits.
* For positions located in Quebec, foreign workers may need to obtain a Certificat d'acceptation du Qu√©bec (CAQ) in addition to the work permit.

Overall, the process for obtaining a Canadian temporary work permit involves coordination between the employer, the foreign worker, and Canadian immigration authorities to ensure compliance with regulations and successful entry into Canada for work purposes.
