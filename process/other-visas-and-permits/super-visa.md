# Super Visa

**Overview**

The Parent and Grandparent Super Visa enables Canadian citizens' and permanent residents' parents and grandparents to visit Canada as visitors for up to two consecutive years during their initial visit, without needing to renew their status. This visa can remain valid for up to 10 years, allowing multiple re-entries during this period, providing an extended visitation option for older family members without work rights.

**Who Can Apply for the Super Visa?**

Parents or grandparents of Canadian citizens and permanent residents are eligible to apply for the Super Visa. Applicants must not be deemed inadmissible to Canada due to health or security reasons and may need to fulfill specific conditions stipulated by the visa office processing their application. It's essential to note that no dependents can be included in this application. Only parents or grandparents, along with their spouses or common-law partners, may be included.

**The Application Process**

The application process parallels that of a regular Temporary Resident Visa (TRV), with additional documentation required to ensure sufficient support for the parents and grandparents during their stay in Canada. This documentation includes:

* A letter of invitation from the child or grandchild residing in Canada.
* Documents demonstrating that the child or grandchild meets the Low Income Cut-Off (LICO) minimum.
* Proof of parental relationship with the child or grandchild, such as a birth certificate naming them as a parent.
* Proof of medical insurance coverage for at least one year from a Canadian insurance company.

All Super Visa applicants must undergo a medical examination, with forms and instructions provided by the visa office after the application submission.
