# French Speaking Essential Non-Health Care Workers in Canada

**General Guidelines**

* **Working in Canada**: You must be employed in Canada at the time of your application.
* **Occupation**: You can work in any occupation during the application process. Essential workers need 1,560 work hours in an eligible occupation within the past three years, and graduate stream applicants require a Canadian credential.
* **Completed Application**: Ensure you submit a fully completed application with all required documents, including language tests, and pay the fees.
* **Multiple Streams**: You can apply to multiple streams if desired, but separate fees apply for each application.
* **Intake Process**: Applications are processed on a first-come, first-served basis.
* **Quebec Residents**: Residents of Quebec may still be eligible if they demonstrate intent to move to another province or have a job offer from another province.
* **Self-employed Experience**: Self-employed experience does not count for these streams.
* **Document Signatures**: Wet signatures are not required on documents except for representative forms; an attestation at the end of the online application serves as a signature.
* **Fee Payment**: Fees can be paid online in advance, and the receipt uploaded with your application, or paid through the online portal. Overpayments result in automatic refunds from IRCC.
