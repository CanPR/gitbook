# Receive AOR After Submission

**Navigating the Canadian Citizenship Application Process: After Applying**

After you've submitted your application for Canadian citizenship, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will communicate with you through various channels to keep you informed about the status of your application. Here's what you can expect:

**A) Confirmation of Application Acceptance:**

* Shortly after submitting your application, you'll receive confirmation from IRCC that they have accepted your application for processing. This confirmation may be sent via email or regular mail.

**B) Study Guide for Citizenship Test:**

* IRCC will provide you with access to the study guide "Discover Canada: The Rights and Responsibilities of Citizenship." You'll receive a link to the online version or a paper copy of the guide, depending on your preference. This guide will help you prepare for the citizenship test.

**C) Invitation to Citizenship Test and Interview:**

* If you're between the ages of 18 and 54, IRCC will invite you to attend your citizenship test and interview. They will provide you with details about the date, time, and location of the test, as well as a list of documents you'll need to bring with you.

**D) Invitation to Citizenship Ceremony:**

* Upon approval of your application, IRCC will invite you to attend your citizenship ceremony. This ceremony is a significant milestone where you'll take the Oath of Citizenship and officially become a Canadian citizen.

**Tips for Successful Communication with IRCC:**

* Ensure that your contact information provided in your application is accurate and up-to-date to receive important updates from IRCC.
* Monitor your email and physical mailbox regularly for any communication from IRCC to avoid missing important deadlines or instructions.
* If you have any questions or concerns about the process or the information provided by IRCC, don't hesitate to reach out to them for clarification.
