# What is Express Entry?

Express Entry is Canada's flagship application management system for key economic immigration programs.

Potential candidates express their interest in immigrating to Canada by first completing an online profile. The profile is electronically screened to determine if the candidate meets the criteria of at least 1 of the 3 federal immigration programs mentioned above.

Using the same information, candidates are given a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. They are then placed in the Express Entry pool and ranked relative to each other based on their CRS scores.

The pool is dynamic and a candidate’s rank can change as other candidates join and leave the pool, or when the ranking criteria are adjusted according to ministerial instructions.

CRS scores can also change as a candidate’s circumstances change, e.g. a candidate gains more work experience or is nominated by a province or territory. Only top-ranked candidates are invited to apply for permanent residence.
