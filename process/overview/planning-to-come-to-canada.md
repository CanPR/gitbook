# Planning to come to Canada

Take a piece of paper and write down why you want to come to Canada. Outline your settlement plan; try to research how you would support yourself and your job prospects in Canada.

Please do not paint a rosy picture, don’t think Canada will be a land of milk and honey right after you land here. You have to build a life for yourself so DO NOT plan to relax as soon as you get here. &#x20;

Deciding to come to Canada will take you on a long journey that will have its ups and downs, so do not be disheartened and continue moving ahead.

If you are determined to work smart and put in sincere efforts once you get here, you will be a successful immigrant in your new home – Canada.
