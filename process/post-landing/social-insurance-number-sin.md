# Social Insurance Number (SIN)

**Social Insurance Number (SIN)**

All Canadian citizens, newcomers, and temporary residents who want access to government programs or who want to work in Canada are required to have a Social Insurance Number (SIN) - a unique number that identifies each individual.

After ‘landing,’ you’ll have to visit the nearest Services Canada Office for the SIN Card.

You get the SIN No. immediately as a ‘print-out’ -signed & stamped upon applying, the same day, the same time.
