**What if I Need to Travel Back Immediately After Landing in Canada?**

In compliance with IATA and CBSA regulations, entry into Canada without a Permanent Resident Card (PRC) is not permitted. However, if entering Canada through a border post by road, presenting the Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR) is sufficient for entry and exit. For air travel and entry through an airport, the COPR alone will not be sufficient, and passengers will be denied boarding by airline staff.

In such cases, the process involves applying for a Temporary Permanent Resident Travel Document (PRTD-A31(3)) at the local Canadian High Commission (CHC) abroad, which costs CAD 50. Detailed instructions can be found in the 'Manual for Permanent Resident Card' (ENF 27).
