# Applying for a Driving License

Obtaining an Ontario Driver's License involves several steps:

1. **Prepare Required Documents:** Gather your original Driver's License (DL) from your home country, Passport, Landing papers/PR card (if applicable), and any other identification documents requested by the licensing authority.
2. **Token Number and Wait:** Visit the local driver's licensing office or test center. Depending on the process in your region, you may need to take a token number or wait in line for your turn.
3. **Document Verification and Payment:** Your documents will be verified by the licensing authority, and you'll need to pay any required fees for testing or license issuance.
4. **Written Test:** Depending on the local regulations, you may need to take a written test covering traffic rules, road signs, and driving regulations. Study materials may be available online or provided by the licensing authority.
5. **Receive Temporary License:** If you pass the written test, you may receive a temporary or provisional license that allows you to drive with restrictions while waiting for your permanent license.
6. **Driving Lessons (Optional):** Consider taking driving lessons from a certified instructor to familiarize yourself with local driving laws and practices. This step is optional but recommended, especially if you're new to driving in the region. (Will reduce your insurance payments.)
7. **Book Road Test:** Schedule a road test with the licensing authority. The road test will assess your practical driving skills, including vehicle control, observation, and adherence to traffic laws.
8. **Road Test:** Take the road test as scheduled. If you pass, you'll receive your driver's license from the licensing authority. If you fail, you may be required to retake the test after a waiting period and additional practice.
9. **License Issuance:** Upon successful completion of the road test, the licensing authority will issue your driver's license. This license will allow you to legally operate a motor vehicle in the region, subject to any restrictions or conditions imposed by local regulations.

_**NOTE:** Providing a DL extract with over three years of driving experience may allow you to skip the G2 road test and proceed directly to the G test. However, failing the G test means you must first pass the G2 test before attempting the G test again._
