* Payments are typically made in the year you apply and in the following year, providing regular financial support to eligible recipients.

**3. Eligibility Criteria:**

* Eligibility for the GST/HST credit is based on factors such as income, family size, and marital status.
* To qualify, individuals and families must file an income tax return each year, even if they have no income to report.
