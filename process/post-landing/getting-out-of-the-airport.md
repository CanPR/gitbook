# Getting Out of the Airport

#### Transportation Options from the Airport

Upon landing as an immigrant, you have several transportation options to reach your destination from the airport.

**1) Taxi Service:**

* **Hire a Taxi:** This is the most convenient but also the most expensive option. Taxis are readily available outside the airport terminals.

**2) Ridesharing Apps:**

* **Use Ridesharing Apps:** Services like Uber or Lyft provide a convenient and often more cost-effective alternative to traditional taxis. Simply download the app, book a ride, and wait for your driver to arrive.

**3) Pre-Booked Car Services:**

* **Pre-Booked Car Operators:** For a hassle-free experience, consider pre-booking a car from multiple operators that are available in the city you land in.&#x20;
