# Canadian Tax System

Navigating Canadian taxes can be daunting, but resources are available to help. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) offers free online courses tailored for individuals new to the income tax system. These courses provide a fundamental understanding of Canada's income tax system, guide you through completing a simple tax return, and address common tax-related inquiries.

Furthermore, the CRA website is a valuable resource with comprehensive information on completing income tax and benefit returns. If you find yourself unable to complete your income tax and benefit return independently, consider utilizing the free Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP). This program offers assistance from trained volunteers who can help you navigate the tax filing process.
