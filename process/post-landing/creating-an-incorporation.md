# Creating an Incorporation

**Incorporating Your Business in Canada**

Incorporation is the process of establishing a new legal entity known as a corporation or company. A corporation enjoys the same rights and obligations under Canadian law as a natural person.

**Benefits of Incorporating:**

Incorporating your business offers various advantages, including:

* Creation of a separate legal entity
* Limited liability protection
* Access to lower corporate tax rates
* Improved access to capital and grants
* Continuous existence regardless of changes in ownership or management.

**Steps to Incorporating:**

To register your business as a corporation in Canada, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Choose a Business Name:** Decide between a Numbered Company or a Named Company.
2. **Complete Articles of Incorporation:** Provide necessary details and submit the articles of incorporation.
3. **Establish Registered Office and Board of Directors:** Set up the initial registered office address and appoint the first board of directors.
4. **File Forms and Pay Fees:** File the appropriate forms and pay the required fees for incorporation.
5. **Process Application:** Allow time for processing your application.
6. **Complete Provincial and Territorial Registration:** Register your corporation provincially and fulfill any additional requirements.

**Additional Considerations:**

* For a Named Company, conduct a name search and obtain a NUANS report before finalizing the business name.
* Determine the jurisdiction of taxes by registering for each province where you will provide services.
