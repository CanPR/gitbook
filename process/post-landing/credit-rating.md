**Managing Your Credit Score in Canada:**

Credit score matters significantly in Canada, and newcomers can take proactive steps to understand and manage it effectively. Here are some tips to help you navigate the Canadian credit system:

**1. Use Credit Cards Wisely:**

* Start using a credit card rather than relying solely on debit cards or cash payments. Using a credit card responsibly can help build your credit history in Canada.

**2. Pay Bills on Time:**

* Timely bill payments are crucial for maintaining a good credit score. Make it a priority to pay your bills, including credit card bills, on time to demonstrate responsible financial behavior.

**3. Boosting and Managing Your Credit Score:**

* Your credit score plays a significant role in accessing loans and other financial products. Focus on building positive credit habits and managing your credit score effectively.
* Maintaining a great credit score and practicing good banking habits can lead to lower interest rates on loans and other financial benefits.

**4. Establish Monthly Spending Habits:**

* Develop monthly spending habits by tracking your expenses and allocating a portion of your income for savings. Consistency in managing your finances is key to improving your credit score over time.

**5. Utilize Credit Cards Wisely:**

* Aim to utilize only 50% of your credit card limit and pay off the balance after your statement is generated. This responsible usage demonstrates financial discipline and contributes to a positive credit history.

**6. Be Cautious with Credit Increases:**

* When offered a credit increase, inquire if it is pre-approved to avoid unnecessary credit inquiries that could negatively impact your credit score. As a newcomer, you may not always qualify for credit increases, so be cautious.

**7. Avoid Store-Specific Credit Cards:**

* Refrain from obtaining store-specific credit cards, such as those offered by Walmart and other superstores, if possible. These cards may have limited benefits and could potentially impact your credit score.

**8. Check Your Credit Score Regularly:**

* Take advantage of free credit score checking services like CreditKarma, Borrowell/CIBC App, and Mogo.ca. Regularly monitoring your credit score allows you to stay informed about your financial standing without impacting your credit score (soft inquiry).
