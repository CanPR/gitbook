# Your First Canadian Job

**Employment Opportunities and Rights in Ontario**

When you arrive in Ontario, you may initially need to take a job outside your field to support yourself. It's important to research your options and understand your employment rights in Ontario.

**Survival Jobs**

Your first job in Ontario, or anywhere in Canada, might be a survival job - one that helps you pay the bills. These jobs could include roles such as cashier, customer service representative, factory worker, taxi driver, or data entry operator. While not directly related to your profession, survival jobs offer valuable Canadian work experience, language practice, and networking opportunities within your field.

**Temporary Jobs**

Temporary jobs provide another way to gain work experience, understand different industries, and earn income. You can apply for temporary positions by registering with employment or temporary agencies. These agencies specialize in placing individuals in specific fields like technology, office assistance, or security. Some temporary positions may lead to long-term employment opportunities or even full-time roles with the company.

Research employment agencies carefully before registering, and keep copies of any contracts. You can find a list of reputable agencies from organizations like the Association of Canadian Search, Employment & Staffing Services or The Directory of Canadian Recruiters.

**Alternative Jobs**

While waiting to obtain professional licensing in your field, you might consider working in a non-regulated role related to your profession. For instance, a registered nurse could explore positions as a nurse’s aide, personal support worker (PSW), or health educator. This allows you to utilize your skills and gain Canadian work experience. Settlement.Org provides information on alternative jobs for various healthcare and other professions.

**Employee Rights**

Ontario's Employment Standards Act (ESA) outlines regulations regarding wages, overtime, hours of work, breaks, public holidays, vacations, leaves, and termination pay. If you face job loss due to circumstances like pregnancy or sickness, you may qualify for Employment Insurance benefits. In case of workplace injuries, you may be eligible for workers’ compensation benefits.

If you encounter any issues at work, you can seek assistance by contacting the Ministry of Labour at 1-800-531-5551 or the Workers’ Action Centre at 416-531-0778.
