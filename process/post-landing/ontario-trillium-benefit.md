# Ontario Trillium Benefit

**Understanding the Ontario Trillium Benefit for Newcomers:**

The Ontario Trillium Benefit (OTB) is a tax credit designed to support low-income families in Ontario. Here's what newcomers need to know about this benefit:

**Determining Eligibility:**

* Newcomers may be eligible for the OTB if they qualify for the Ontario Energy and Property Tax Credit, the Ontario Sales Tax Credit, or the Northern Ontario Energy Credit.
* Eligibility is based on factors such as income level, residency, and family status.

**Payment Options:**

* Recipients of the OTB can choose between receiving payments monthly or annually.
* Monthly payments provide earlier access to funds, while annual payments are received as a lump sum at the end of the benefit year.
* If the benefit amount is less than $360, payment is made annually in July.

**Filing Requirements:**

* To claim the OTB, newcomers must file their tax return, even if they have no income.
* Form ON-BEN (Application for the Ontario Trillium Benefit and the Ontario Senior Homeowners Property Tax Grant) must be completed and included with the tax return.
* Filing tax returns on time, by April 30, is crucial to avoid delays in receiving OTB payments.

**Application Process:**

1. **File Tax Return:** Submit a tax return to claim the OTB, regardless of income.
2. **Complete Form ON-BEN:** Fill out Form ON-BEN and include it with the tax return. If forgotten, adjustments can be made through CRA My Account or by mail.
3. **Annual Renewal:** Newcomers must apply for the OTB each tax year. Eligibility is assessed based on the previous year's family net income, which may fluctuate due to various factors.

By understanding the eligibility criteria, payment options, and application process for the Ontario Trillium Benefit, newcomers to Ontario can access financial support to help meet their needs and contribute to their well-being in their new home province.
