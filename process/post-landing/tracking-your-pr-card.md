# \*\*Tracking Your PR Card

**Steps to Link Your PR Card Application After Landing**

After landing in Canada, follow these steps to link your Permanent Resident (PR) Card application to your account. Please note that you have up to 5 attempts in one day.

1. **Log in to your CIC account.**
2. **Navigate to the "Link an existing application to this account" section.** Click on the "Link application to this account" button.
3. **Select the category as PR Card.**
4. **Provide your Unique Client Identifier (UCI) and Family Name.**
5. **Fill in the required details.** Ensure correct capitalization and punctuation.
6. **Enter your landing date in the "Date you became a permanent resident" field.**
7. **Click on "Search my application."**
8. **Once the application is found, make sure to apply.** Failure to do so will prevent it from being linked.

After successfully linking your application, it will show a "Submitted" status. When it is ready for dispatch, the status will change to "Approved." If you receive a photo request, the status will not change.

_**NOTE**: Regularly check PR card processing time on the CIC website as photo requests or PR card approvals come in the last 5-10 days._
