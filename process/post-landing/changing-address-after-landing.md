# Changing Address After Landing

To change your address with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), you have three options:

1. **Online Service:**
   * Use the online service provided by IRCC to change your address. Here's the link: [Change of Address Notification Online Service](https://services3.cic.gc.ca/ecas/?app=coanotify\&lang=en)
2. **IRCC Webform:**
   * If the online service is not accessible for any reason, you can use the IRCC Webform to submit your address change request. Visit the following link: [IRCC Webform](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/contacts/web-form.asp)
3. **CIC Call Center:**
   * As an alternative option, you can call the CIC Call Center to change your address. However, please note that this option is available only after you have already moved to your new address.
   * Contact Number: 1-888-242-2100

Choose the method that is most convenient for you to ensure your address is updated with IRCC accurately and promptly.
