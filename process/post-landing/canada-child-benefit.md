**Child Benefit Entitlement and Calculation Tips:**

1. **Determine Your Eligibility:**
   * If your gross family income is less than $30,000 CAD gross, you may be entitled to receive benefits per child paid in the consecutive year directly to your bank account.
2. **Calculate Benefit Amount:**
   * For children aged 2 to 18 years: You may receive $5,400 CAD per year per child.
   * For children aged 0 to 2 years: You may receive $6,400 CAD per year per child.
3. **Adjustments Based on Family Income:**
   * If your family income falls between $30,000 CAD and $65,000 CAD:
     * Deduct 7% from the base benefit amount for one child, or 13.5% for two children.
     * For example, if your income is $40,000 CAD with one child, deduct 7% of (40K-30K)(0.07) = $700 CAD from the base benefit.
   * If your gross family income is above $65,000 CAD:
     * Deduct 7% plus an additional percentage for each child.
     * For example, if your income is $75,000 CAD with one child, deduct 7% of (65K-30K)(0.07)= $2,450 CAD, plus an additional 14% of (75K-65K)(0.14) = $1,400 CAD.
4. **Benefit Calculation Example:**
   * Using the example of a $75,000 CAD income with one child:
     * Deducting $2,450 CAD + $1,400 CAD from the base benefit of $5,400 CAD gives a total benefit of $1,550 CAD per year.
