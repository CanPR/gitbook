# Bringing Your Parents/Grandparents to Canada

**Bringing Parents/Grandparents to Canada: A Guide for Newcomers**

Bringing your parents or grandparents to Canada involves several options, each with its own set of requirements and procedures. Here's an overview of the three main pathways:

**1. Regular Visitor (TRV):**

* Parents or grandparents can apply for a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) as regular visitors.
* They must demonstrate ties to their home country to convince immigration officers of their intention to return after their visit.
* The TRV can be single entry or multiple entries, with a maximum stay of six months per entry, extendable for another six months.

_**NOTE:** Insurance is not mandatory but recommended for medical coverage during their stay in Canada._

**2. Super Visa:**

* Similar to a TRV but with additional requirements, including proof of financial support from their child or grandchild in Canada.
* Applicants must provide documents such as a letter of invitation, proof of income of the child/grandchild, proof of parental relationship, and valid private medical insurance.
* The Super Visa allows multiple entries for up to ten years, with stays of up to two years per visit.

_**NOTE:** The Super Visa program is beneficial for citizens of visa-exempt countries due to its longer validity and stay periods._

**3. Parents and Grandparents PR Visa (PGP):**

* Under the Family Class sponsorship program, Canadian citizens or permanent residents can sponsor their parents or grandparents for Canadian permanent residence.
* Sponsors must meet eligibility criteria, including age, income requirements, and signing an undertaking to support their family members financially.
* The application process involves submitting notices of assessment from the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) to prove income eligibility and completing an expression of interest (EOI) form with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (CIC).

_**NOTE:** Sponsors must demonstrate the minimum necessary income level for three consecutive years and the application process involves a random lottery draw to select eligible applicants._
