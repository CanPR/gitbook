# Getting your PR Card

**PR Card Application and Delivery Process:**

Once you arrive in Canada and complete the landing process, you will also apply for your Permanent Resident (PR) Card, which is an essential document for permanent residents. Here's what you need to know:

**1. PR Card Application at POE:**

* Your PR Card application (IMM 5444E) will be completed at the Point of Entry (POE) itself, as part of the PR package provided to you free of charge.
* The information and photos required for the PR Card will be the same as those you supplied for the Permanent Resident Visa (PPR).

**2. Delivery of PR Card:**

* Your PR Card will be delivered to you via regular postal mail within 3-6 weeks, with an average processing time of 4 weeks.
* It is advisable to remain in Canada for at least 45 days to ensure you can receive your PR Card in person before considering leaving the country.

**3. Collecting PR Card and Departure:**

* Upon receiving your PR Card, it is recommended to stay in Canada for at least 45 days to collect it personally.
* If you need to leave Canada before your PR Card arrives, you will need to make arrangements for its collection and forwarding to you overseas, preferably through a friend or relative. However, this is not recommended due to the risk of loss during transit.
* Losing the PR Card in transit can lead to a cumbersome process of obtaining new ones, so it's crucial to take necessary precautions to avoid such situations.

Your Permanent Resident (PR) Card is a crucial document that you will receive after completing your PR application process. Here are some important tips to consider regarding your PR Card:

**2. Cost of Renewal:**

* The initial PR Card is provided free of charge. However, renewals cost $50 per card.

**3. Avoid Mailing Outside Canada:**

  * Risk of loss or theft during transit.
  * Potential identity theft if the card falls into the wrong hands.
  * Possibility of significant delays in delivery due to external factors such as service strikes or other disruptions.
* There is an understanding between Canada Post and CIC regarding interception and return of PR Cards found to be internationally bound.

**4. Risks of Customs Seizure:**

* Customs officials at the destination may seize the mail containing the PR Card for various reasons.
* Sending the PR Card outside of Canada carries inherent risks, and any loss or delay in delivery is the sender's responsibility.
