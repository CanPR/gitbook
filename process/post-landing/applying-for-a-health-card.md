# Applying for a Health Card

**Obtaining a Health Card**

A Health Card is required to access provincial healthcare services covered by OHIP, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan. All Canadian residents are covered for major medical and hospital costs by provincial health insurance programs.

**Important Notes:**

* Health Cards are provincial, not federal. If you change provinces, you'll need to reapply for the respective province's Health Card. There may be a waiting period before your coverage becomes active.

**Application Process:**

To apply for the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP), follow these steps:

1. **Visit a Service Ontario Office:** Bring your physical PR card and any photo ID as proof of address (e.g., Driving license, Credit Card Statement).
2. **Complete OHIP Application Form:** You can download the application form from the Ontario government website or fill it out at the Service Ontario office.
   * Application Form: [OHIP Application Form](https://www.ontario.ca/page/apply-ohip-and-get-health-card)
3. **Submission Process:** Submit your completed application form along with the required documents at the Service Ontario office.
4. **Verification and Confirmation:** A Service Ontario representative will review your application and verify your documents. Once everything is in order, you'll be asked to sign the application form and provide additional information as needed.
5. **Photo and Card Signing:** You'll have your photo taken and sign another card provided by the Service Ontario office.
6. **Confirmation of Application:** You will receive a confirmation of your application along with the date on which your OHIP coverage will become valid. This coverage usually begins three months from your date of landing in Canada.

_**NOTE:** During the first three months while waiting for your Health Card, you might be able to access certain free healthcare services at Community Health Centers (CHCs). CHCs are non-profit organizations that provide primary health care for individuals, families, and communities._

**The Waiting Period:**

Alberta \[e.g. Calgary, Edmonton etc.] & Manitoba \[e.g. Winnipeg] are the only provinces where there is NO WAITING period for Health Insurance. In all other provinces there is a waiting period to get Health Benefits. In Ontario \[e.g. Toronto, Ottawa etc.] it is 3 months.
