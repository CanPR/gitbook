**Understanding OSAP: Financial Aid for College or University**

The Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) is a vital financial aid program designed to assist students in covering the costs of college or university education.

**Types of Funding:**

1. **Grants:** Grants are funds provided to students that do not require repayment.
2. **Student Loans:** OSAP also offers student loans, which must be repaid after completing studies.

When you apply for OSAP, you are automatically considered for both grants and loans. If you prefer not to take out a loan, you have the option to decline it after your application is approved.

**Repayment Programs:**

OSAP offers programs to help students manage loan repayment after completing their education. Additionally, full-time students may qualify for free tuition.

**Eligibility Criteria:**

To qualify for OSAP, Ontario must be the last province in which you resided for 12 consecutive months without being a full-time postsecondary student. If you lived in another Canadian province or territory within the last 12 months, you must contact that province's or territory's student assistance program to determine eligibility for assistance.

Exceptions to this rule may apply, so if you are uncertain, you should reach out to the Financial Aid Office of the college or university you plan to attend. Alternatively, you can call the OSAP toll-free line if you attend or plan to attend a post-secondary school outside of Ontario at 1-800-387-5514.
